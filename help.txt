~~~~brainfuck-interpreter~~~~

A simple brainfuck interpreter written in Haskell.

Invoking the program without any flags will run the program in interpreting mode.

In this mode, you can enter a program on a single line and it will run immediately.

Programs cannot be spread across lines in this mode. Use a file for longer programs.

Hit enter to run the line you just entered.

Note: state is not saved across lines, so you can't enter a long program line by line.

## Flags:

#### -f / --file
Specify a file to run the interpreter on.

Usage: `./brainfuck-interpreter --file "helloworld.bf"`

This will run the interpreter on the file helloworld.bf, if it is present.
If it isn't, the program will run in interpreting mode.

#### -h / --help
Output this help message.

Usage: `./brainfuck-interpreter --help
