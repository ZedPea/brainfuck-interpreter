Simple brainfuck interpreter written in Haskell.

More features will be added as I go.

Currently things to be added include a standard cell size so overflow can be exploited, potentially dynamic arrays, and I will look at end of file behaviour

I also need to add reading from specified files, and cli options, maybe even a realtime interpreter
